## Features üöÄ

- Full-featured registration workflow.

## Development

Rockit uses a monorepo structure and is split into the following packages.

- [webapp](https://github.com/Issue-Tracker-M/issue-tracker/tree/main/packages/webapp) to manage installation of dependencies and
  running various scripts. We also have yarn workspaces enabled by default.
- [api](https://github.com/Issue-Tracker-M/issue-tracker/tree/main/packages/api) for rapid UI component development and
  testing
- [types](https://github.com/Issue-Tracker-M/issue-tracker/tree/main/packages/types) for testing components and
  hooks
- [components](https://github.com/Issue-Tracker-M/issue-tracker/tree/main/packages/components) for a blazing fast documentation website.
  versioning and changelogs


### Tooling

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for rapid UI component development and

  hooks
